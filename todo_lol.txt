1 create Frontend with Html  ✔

2 add css
    - add background for generated <li> itemes. ✔ 
     - add on hover effect ✔ 
        -> dont know if this is made with css, basically I want the
           background of the hoverd <li> item to get highlighted in a
           diffrent way then the rest of the <li> items. ✔ 
    - add striketrough, when hovered <li> item is clicked.
        -> doesnt need to be delted, the delte button handles that, 
           I do want visual representation of tasks that are done. ✔ 

3 add functionality with typescript
    - push new textbox string into array ✔ 
    - add eventlistner for button to push new li item in array ✔    
    - array needs to be emptied, when the delete button is clicked  ✔
    - logic error, right now every time the add or enter event are triggered a new ul is created ✔
      this meann , if an item is checked it loses its class, needs rewrite of code. 
    - add function to delete list by pressing the del button. ✔
